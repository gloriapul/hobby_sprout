# Assignment 4c Reflection

This project was a challenging but ultimately positive journey that gave me a deeper look into full-stack application web development.

### What was hard or easy?

-   **Hardest Part:** The integration of my front and backend was a very tedious process. In general, backend was hard since I have had less experience with it. The syncs in particular in this final assignment required a lot of time for me to reflect on to understand how to break down each sync and how they all work together to make the app what it is. By far, the syncs took the most time.

-   **Easiest Part:** The easiest part of this assignment was frontend for me as I have had experience there. I enjoyed doing the visual study and narrowing down what the appearance of my application should be. 

### What went well?

Other than generally frontend, the initial coding of my concept actions went well. Having those concept specifications we had made early on and received feedback on helped a lot when transferring into a code version.  

### Mistakes Made and Future Prevention

-   **Mistake:** A key mistake in the initial design was underestimating the complexity required on the backend to support what seemed like relatively simple features. Especially when I first started with the syncs, I struggled with using an agentic coding tool and it changing around for instance, arrays to dictionaries. 

-   **Prevention:** After working on my first sync, I continued to see the importance of small changes. Doing one sync at a time was helpful and in general, moving in steps, is a good tip for the future. 

### Skills Acquired

-   **Backend:** I gained many skills when it came to backend code. I appreciated how we first did the concepts and then introduced syncs. I also learned about deno, which is a cool tool for future use. Considering security was also pretty new to me and I appreciated learning about how to make my app more secure, especially with session ids. Backend code writing is definitely something I still need to work on as I think about the different types of apps I could work on. It would be interesting to learn more about web scraping.

-   **Testing:** I had not thought about testing in such depth. These assignments were extremely important for me to develop testing skills, including knowing best ways to break down tests, incorporating print statements, and knowing how to even set them up. 

-   **UI/UX:** It was a new way of thinking to put myself in the user's shoes. 

### Use of an Agentic Coding Tool & Conclusions on the Role of LLMs in Software Development

I used Context to help me set up my concepts and for saving them. I also used Github Copilot as a pair programmer. Initially, I was skeptical about using LLMs since this was my first time using them for coding beyond basic questions. It turned out to be a good experience though. They are helpful for speed since they are good at identifying patterns and for avoiding small bugs that can take a long time to debug. It was challenging when an LLM would repeat an incorrect answer even with additional instructions. The role of LLMs in software development will likely continue to grow and this project was helpful for letting me see all the LLMs have to offer!
