# MilestoneTracker Design Changes

## Changes from Original Implementation

### 1. Data Persistence
- Changed from in-memory arrays to MongoDB collections
- Added proper database schema and types
- Implemented async/await patterns for all operations

### 2. Error Handling
- Added typed responses for all methods
- Improved error messages and validation
- Added database operation error handling

### 3. Step Management
- Added timestamps for step creation and completion
- Improved step status tracking
- Added automatic milestone closure when all steps complete

### 4. Type Safety
- Added TypeScript interfaces for all data structures
- Implemented union types for responses
- Added runtime type checking

## Rationale for Changes

### Data Persistence
The switch to MongoDB provides:
- Data persistence across server restarts
- Better scalability
- Concurrent access handling
- Proper database transactions

### Error Handling
Improved error handling was needed to:
- Provide better user feedback
- Ensure data consistency
- Handle edge cases properly
- Make debugging easier

### Step Management
Enhanced step tracking to:
- Provide better progress monitoring
- Enable future analytics
- Support automatic milestone management

### Type Safety
Added type safety to:
- Catch errors at compile time
- Improve code maintainability
- Make the API more predictable
- Ensure data consistency

## Implementation Notes

These changes maintain the core functionality while making the implementation more robust and production-ready. The changes align with the assignment requirements for proper MongoDB integration and concept independence.
