# Design Changes for QuizMatchmaker Concept

This document reflects on the changes for the QuizMatchmaker concept from its initial specification in the assignment to this final implementation.

## Original Concept Design (Assignment 2)

Not applicable since in assignment 2, quiz matchmaker did not have its own concept. The feedback from assignment 2 led me to formally make this concept. 

## Changes Made During Implementation

1. **Hardcoded Questions**: 
   - Implemented questions as a hardcoded array in the concept rather than in a database
   - Each question has a unique ID, text, and order field
   - This ensures the questions remain consistent and immutable as specified in the concept

2. **LLM Integration**: 
   - Added integration with Google's Gemini LLM using GeminiLLM utility
   - Created specialized prompting that directs the LLM to return a single hobby name
   - Implemented error handling for LLM unavailability or response parsing issues

3. **Type Safety**:
   - Added TypeScript interfaces and types for better code reliability:
     - `UserResponseDoc` for answer documents
     - `HobbyMatchDoc` for match result documents
     - `HardcodedQuestion` for question structure

4. **Error Messages**:
   - Added explicit error handling with descriptive messages:
     - Submission validation: `Question with ID ${question} is not a valid predefined quiz question.`
     - Duplicate response: `User ${user} has already submitted a response for question ${question}.`
     - Response updates: `No existing response found for user ${user} and question ${question}.`
     - LLM errors: `LLM service not available. Please provide a valid API key.`

5. **Query Methods**:
   - Implemented helpful query methods to access the concept's state:
     - `_getQuestions()`: Returns all predefined questions
     - `_getUserResponses({ user })`: Returns all responses for a specific user
     - `_getMatchedHobby({ user })`: Returns the matched hobby for a user

6. **Constraints Enforcement**:
   - Added proper validation to enforce concept constraints:
     - Prevents updating responses if a match already exists
     - Ensures all questions must be answered before generating a match
     - Prevents generating multiple matches for the same user

## Evaluation Against Original Requirements

The implemented QuizMatchmaker concept fulfills all the original requirements I had in mind with it matching a user while adding more robust error handling and validation. The core functionality remains intact: users can submit answers to predefined questions, update their answers, and receive a personalized hobby match generated by an LLM.
