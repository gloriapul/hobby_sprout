Principle: User registers with unique credentials and authenticates as the same user ...
------- output -------
1. Creating a new user account with username and password
   ✓ User registered successfully with ID: 0199f8c8-ff9b-743b-837d-694f0ebadfb0
2. Authenticating with the same username and password
   ✓ User authenticated successfully with the same ID: 0199f8c8-ff9b-743b-837d-694f0ebadfb0
3. Principle satisfied: User can register and authenticate as the same identity
----- output end -----
Principle: User registers with unique credentials and authenticates as the same user ... ok (896ms)
Action: register enforces username uniqueness ...
------- output -------
1. Testing username uniqueness requirement
   • Registering first user with username "uniqueuser"
   ✓ First registration succeeded as expected
   • Attempting to register a second user with the same username "uniqueuser"
   ✓ Second registration failed with error: "Username 'uniqueuser' is already taken."
2. Username uniqueness requirement satisfied
----- output end -----
Action: register enforces username uniqueness ... ok (636ms)
Action: authentication validates credentials and returns appropriate errors ...
------- output -------
1. Testing authentication credential validation
   • Registering test user "secureuser" for authentication tests
   ✓ Test user registered successfully
   • Attempting to authenticate with correct username but wrong password
   ✓ Authentication correctly failed with wrong password
   • Attempting to authenticate with non-existent username
   ✓ Authentication correctly failed with non-existent username
2. Authentication validation requirements satisfied
----- output end -----
Action: authentication validates credentials and returns appropriate errors ... ok (641ms)
