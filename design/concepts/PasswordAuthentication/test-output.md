# Test Results for PasswordAuthentication Concept

Principle: User registers with unique credentials and authenticates as the same user ...
------- output -------
1. Creating a new user account with username and password
   ✓ User registered successfully with ID: 019a616b-99e4-7744-9501-9fe4eec87e77
2. Authenticating with the same username and password
   ✓ User authenticated successfully with the same ID: 019a616b-99e4-7744-9501-9fe4eec87e77
3. Principle satisfied: User can register and authenticate as the same identity
----- output end -----
Principle: User registers with unique credentials and authenticates as the same user ... ok (714ms)
Action: register enforces username uniqueness ...
------- output -------
1. Testing username uniqueness requirement
   • Registering first user with username "uniqueuser"
   ✓ First registration succeeded as expected
   • Attempting to register a second user with the same username "uniqueuser"
   ✓ Second registration failed with error: "Username 'uniqueuser' is already taken."
2. Username uniqueness requirement satisfied
----- output end -----
Action: register enforces username uniqueness ... ok (721ms)
Action: authentication validates credentials and returns appropriate errors ...
------- output -------
1. Testing authentication credential validation
   • Registering test user "secureuser" for authentication tests
   ✓ Test user registered successfully
   • Attempting to authenticate with correct username but wrong password
   ✓ Authentication correctly failed with wrong password
   • Attempting to authenticate with non-existent username
   ✓ Authentication correctly failed with non-existent username
2. Authentication validation requirements satisfied
----- output end -----
Action: authentication validates credentials and returns appropriate errors ... ok (700ms)
Action: deleteUser permanently removes user and prevents authentication ...
------- output -------
1. Creating a user to test deletion
   ✓ User registered with ID: 019a616b-a254-7bfe-9dc6-d0abc3933a4f
2. Verifying user can authenticate before deletion
   ✓ User authenticated successfully
3. Deleting the user
   ✓ User deleted successfully
4. Verifying user cannot authenticate after deletion
   ✓ Authentication correctly failed after deletion
5. Testing deletion of non-existent user
   ✓ Correctly failed with error: "User 019a616b-a254-7bfe-9dc6-d0abc3933a4f not found."
6. Action requirements satisfied: deleteUser removes credentials permanently
----- output end -----
Action: deleteUser permanently removes user and prevents authentication ... ok (806ms)
