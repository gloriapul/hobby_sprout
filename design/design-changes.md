# HobbySprout Design Changes

This document reflects on the key design changes made to the HobbySprout application during implementation, along with interesting moments from my development process.

## Overall Design Changes

I made two big changes compared to my concepts for Assignment 2 that helped make the focus of HobbySprout more clear and realistic for the project time given. I swapped out one of my concepts, Communities, for a concept called QuizMatchmaker. The Communities concept was intended to offer a hobby group forum where users could make comments, which was intended to help users stay on track for accomplishing their goal. Based on feedback, I removed it as it was making the scope of HobbySprout too large for the project time given by having a social media app, task tracker app, quiz app, and recommendation app all in one. So, I eliminated it and I added QuizMatchmaker as it was necessary to ensure it had its own concept. Originally, I just briefly mentioned having a quiz in one of the actions for MilestoneTracker but based on feedback, it also became clear to me that I had to have its own concept. This cleaned up my code significantly since having the quiz in the other concept would have cluttered MilestoneTracker too much and taken away from its sole focus of generating steps.

Another smaller change to my design application was adding more actions since that gives a user more freedom and can keep them interested if they can do more. That included having a delete step action since it was crucial to have some kind of 'undo' there. Overall, my design became more focused and organized. The syncs to be added in future assignments will show how the concepts can interact in a helpful manner with each other.
