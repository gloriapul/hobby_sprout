# MilestoneTracker Concept Specification

* **concept**: MilestoneTracker \[User]

* **purpose**: Allow users to monitor the progress that they are making toward their goals.

* **principle**: After a user inputs their goal, they will have the option of having an LLM generate their list of recommended steps or will be able to input their own. They can then mark steps as complete, and will be allowed to see those that they have yet to complete and those that have been completed.

* **state**:

* A set of `Goals` with
  \*   a `user` of type `User` (the owner of the goal)
  \*   a `description` of type `String`
  \*   a `hobby` of type `String` (the hobby this goal is associated with)
  \*   an `isActive` of type `Boolean` (true if the goal is currently being tracked)
  \*   A set of `Steps` with
  * a `goalId` of type `Goal` (reference to the parent goal)
  * a `description` of type `String`
  * a `start` of type `Date`
  * a `completion` of type `Date?` (optional, date when the step was completed)
  * an `isComplete` of type `Boolean`

* **actions**:

* `createGoal(user: User, description: String, hobby: String): (goal: Goal)`
  \*   **requires**: No active `Goal` for this `user` and `hobby` already exists. `description` and `hobby` are not empty strings.
  \*   **effects**: Creates a new `Goal` `g`; sets its `user` to `user`, `description` to `description`, and `hobby` to `hobby`; sets `isActive` to `true`; returns `g` as `goal`.

* `generateSteps(goal: Goal): (steps: Step[])`
  \*   **requires**: `goal` exists and is active; no `Steps` are currently associated with this `goal`.
  \*   **effects**: Uses an internal LLM to generate `Step` descriptions based on the `goal`'s description; for each generated description, creates a new `Step` associated with `goal`, sets `description`, `start` (current date), and `isComplete` to `false`; returns the IDs of the created `Steps` as an array `steps`.

* `regenerateSteps(goal: Goal): (steps: Step[])`
  \*   **requires**: `goal` exists and is active.
  \*   **effects**: Deletes all existing `Steps` for the `goal` (regardless of completion status), then uses the internal LLM to generate new `Step` descriptions as in `generateSteps`. For each generated description, creates a new `Step` associated with `goal`, sets `description`, `start` (current date), and `isComplete` to `false`; returns the IDs of the new `Steps` as an array `steps`.
  \*   `addStep(goal: Goal, description: String): (step: Step)`
  * **requires**: `goal` exists and is active; `description` is not an empty string.
  * **effects**: Creates a new `Step` `s`; sets `goalId` to `goal`, `description` to `description`, `start` to current date, and `isComplete` to `false`; returns `s` as `step`.
    \*   `completeStep(step: Step): Empty`
  * **requires**: `step` exists and is not already complete. The `Goal` associated with `step` is active.
  * **effects**: Sets `isComplete` of `step` to `true`; sets `completion` date to current date.
    \*   `removeStep(step: Step): Empty`
  * **requires**: `step` exists; `step` is not complete; the `Goal` associated with `step` is active.
  * **effects**: Deletes the `step` from storage.
    \*   `closeGoal(goal: Goal): Empty`
  * **requires**: `goal` exists and is active.
  * **effects**: Sets `isActive` of `goal` to `false`.

* **queries**:

* `_getGoal(user: User, hobby?: String): (goal: {id: Goal, description: String, hobby: String, isActive: Boolean})[]`
  \*   **requires**: none
  \*   **effects**: Returns an array containing the active `Goal`(s) for the `user` (optionally filtered by `hobby`), including its `id`, `description`, `hobby`, and `isActive` status. Returns empty array if no active goals exist.

* `_getAllGoals(user: User, hobby?: String): (goal: {id: Goal, description: String, hobby: String, isActive: Boolean})[]`
  \*   **requires**: none
  \*   **effects**: Returns an array containing all goals (active and inactive) for the `user` (optionally filtered by `hobby`), including its `id`, `description`, `hobby`, and `isActive` status. Returns empty array if no goals exist.

* `_getSteps(goal: Goal): (step: {id: Step, description: String, start: Date, completion: Date?, isComplete: Boolean})[]`
  * **requires**: none
  * **effects**: Returns an array of all `Steps` for the given `goal`, including their details. Returns empty array if no steps exist.
