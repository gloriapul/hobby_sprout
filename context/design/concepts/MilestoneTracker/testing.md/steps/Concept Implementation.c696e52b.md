# Concept Implementation: MilestoneTracker

## Explanation of `GeminiLLM` utility

Before implementing the `MilestoneTrackerConcept`, it's necessary to have a basic `GeminiLLM` utility available as specified in the import. This utility will encapsulate the interaction with the Google Gemini API. For the purpose of this implementation, we will define a simple version of this utility. In a real application, this would involve proper API client setup and error handling.
