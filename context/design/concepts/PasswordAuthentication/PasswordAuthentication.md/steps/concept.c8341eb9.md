# concept: PasswordAuth

```
concept PasswordAuth [User]

purpose associate usernames and securely hashed passwords with user identities for authentication purposes

principle If a user registers with a unique username and a password, and then subsequently provides that same username and password, they will be successfully authenticated as the registered user.

state
  a set of Users with
    a username String
    a passwordHash String
    a salt String

actions
  register (username: String, password: String): (user: User)
    requires no User with the given `username` already exists
    effects creates a new User `u`; sets `u`'s username to `username`; securely hashes `password` with a generated salt and stores the `passwordHash` and `salt` for `u`; returns `u` as `user`

  register (username: String, password: String): (error: String)
    requires a User with the given `username` already exists
    effects returns an error message indicating the username is taken

  login (username: String, password: String): (user: User)
    requires a User with the given `username` exists AND the `password` matches the stored `passwordHash` for that user
    effects returns the identifier of the authenticated `User` as `user`

  login (username: String, password: String): (error: String)
    requires a User with the given `username` does NOT exist OR the `password` does NOT match the stored `passwordHash`
    effects returns an error message indicating invalid credentials (e.g., "Invalid username or password")

queries
  _getUserByUsername (username: String): (user: User)
    requires a User with the given `username` exists
    effects returns the identifier of the User as `user`

  _getUserByUsername (username: String): (error: String)
    requires a User with the given `username` does NOT exist
    effects returns an error message indicating no such user
```

Next, the necessary utility file for password hashing. **Please note:** The `passwordHelpers.ts` provided here is a simplified simulation for demonstration. In a production environment, you *must* use a robust cryptographic library or the Web Crypto API with strong Key Derivation Functions (like Argon2, scrypt, or PBKDF2 with sufficient iterations) to securely handle passwords.
