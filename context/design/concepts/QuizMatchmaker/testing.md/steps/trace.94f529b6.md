# trace:

This trace outlines the execution of the principle test and exemplifies how individual actions and queries are tested.

**Principle Test Trace: User completes quiz and gets a hobby match**

1. **Setup:**
   * Initialize `QuizMatchmakerConcept` with a fresh database.
   * Clear `userResponses` and `hobbyMatches` collections.
   * Define `TEST_USER_ALICE`.

2. **Retrieve Questions:**
   * `concept._getQuestions()` is called.
   * **Output:** `Retrieved 5 questions.` (Assuming `QUIZ_QUESTIONS` has 5 entries)
   * **Assertion:** `questions.length` is 5.

3. **Submit All Responses (Loop):**
   * For each question `q` in `QUIZ_QUESTIONS`:
     * Generate an `answerText` (e.g., "My answer for Do you prefer spending your free time indoors or outdoors? (question 1)").
     * `concept.submitResponse({ user: TEST_USER_ALICE, question: q._id, answerText: answer })` is called.
     * **Output:** `Submitting for Q1 (Do you prefer spending your free time indoors or outdoors?): My answer for Do you prefer spending your free time indoors or outdoors? (question 1)`
     * **Assertion:** `submitResponse` returns `{}` (success).
   * After the loop, `concept._getUserResponses({ user: TEST_USER_ALICE })` is called.
   * **Assertion:** `userResponsesAfterSubmission.length` is 5.
   * **Output:** `All responses submitted and verified.`

4. **Generate Hobby Match:**
   * `concept.generateHobbyMatch({ user: TEST_USER_ALICE })` is called.
   * **Precondition Check:**
     * Verify `LLM model is initialized` (i.e., `GEMINI_API_KEY` is present). If not, this path branches to an error. For a successful trace, assume it's set.
     * Verify `userResponses.length` is equal to `questions.length` (5 == 5).
     * Verify no existing `HobbyMatch` for `TEST_USER_ALICE`.
   * **LLM Interaction (Simulated/Actual):** The concept constructs a prompt with all questions and Alice's answers. Sends this to the LLM.
   * **LLM Response (Example):** The LLM returns "Gardening".
   * **Assertion:** `generateHobbyMatch` returns `{ matchedHobby: "Gardening" }`.
   * **Output:** `Action: generateHobbyMatch succeeded. Matched hobby: Gardening`
   * **Effect Verification (Database):** A document like `{ _id: "user:Alice", matchedHobby: "Gardening", matchedAt: <current_date> }` is inserted into the `hobbyMatches` collection.

5. **Retrieve Matched Hobby:**
   * `concept._getMatchedHobby({ user: TEST_USER_ALICE })` is called.
   * **Output:** `Query: _getMatchedHobby verified. Retrieved hobby: Gardening`
   * **Assertion:** The query returns `[{ hobby: "Gardening" }]`.

6. **Conclusion:**
   * **Output:** `Principle test complete.`
   * The test successfully demonstrates the flow from submitting all responses to generating and retrieving a hobby match, fulfilling the concept's principle.

**Example Trace for Action: `submitResponse - invalid question ID`**

1. **Setup:**
   * Initialize `QuizMatchmakerConcept` with a fresh database.
   * Define `TEST_USER_BOB`, `INVALID_QUESTION_ID`.
2. **Attempt Submission:**
   * `concept.submitResponse({ user: TEST_USER_BOB, question: INVALID_QUESTION_ID, answerText: "This won't work." })` is called.
   * **Output:** `User: user:Bob, Question: q_invalid, Answer: "This won't work."`
3. **Precondition Check:**
   * `this.getQuestionById(INVALID_QUESTION_ID)` returns `undefined`.
4. **Error Return:**
   * The method returns `{ error: "Question with ID q_invalid is not a valid predefined quiz question." }`.
   * **Output:** `Error as expected: Question with ID q_invalid is not a valid predefined quiz question.`
   * **Assertion:** The returned object contains the expected error message.
5. **State Verification:**
   * No new entry is added to `userResponses` collection. (Implicitly verified by checking return for error)
6. **Conclusion:** The action correctly failed due to the unmet precondition.

**Example Trace for Query: `_getQuestions - retrieves all hardcoded questions`**

1. **Setup:**
   * Initialize `QuizMatchmakerConcept`.
2. **Perform Query:**
   * `concept._getQuestions()` is called.
   * **Output:** `Retrieved 5 questions.`
3. **Result Verification:**
   * The query returns an array of 5 `HardcodedQuestion` objects, sorted by their `order`.
   * **Assertions:**
     * `questions.length` is 5.
     * Each `_id`, `text`, and `order` matches the predefined `QUIZ_QUESTIONS`.
     * The order is correct (e.g., Q1 is `q_1`, Q2 is `q_2`).
   * **Output:** `Questions retrieved and verified for content and order.`
4. **Conclusion:** The query successfully returned the expected hardcoded data.
