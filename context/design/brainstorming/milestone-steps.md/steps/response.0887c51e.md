  "Immediately contact local camera rental shops or friends to secure a user-friendly DSLR or mirrorless camera (e.g., Canon Rebel, Nikon D3500) with a versatile kit lens (e.g., 18-55mm) for pick-up today; prioritize auto-focus and auto-exposure modes.",
  "Dedicate 60-90 minutes to watch concise YouTube tutorials covering the exposure triangle (aperture, shutter speed, ISO), how to use Program (P) or Shutter Priority (Tv/S) modes, autofocus points, basic composition (rule of thirds), and how to review photos on your specific rented camera.",
  "Decide on a primary shooting strategy based on your colorblindness: (A) Shoot predominantly in Black & White mode for consistency, or (B) exclusively use Auto White Balance and commit to well-lit scenes, asking a non-colorblind friend to briefly review test shots for obvious color casts before the event.",
  "Spend 60-90 minutes actively practicing with the rented camera in varied indoor and outdoor lighting; experiment with Program (P) or Shutter Priority (Tv/S) modes, practice focusing on moving subjects, and critically review every test shot for sharpness and exposure on the camera's screen.",
  "Fully charge all camera batteries and format at least two memory cards. Pack the camera, at least one spare charged battery, and a spare memory card. Confirm event location, timing, and any specific photographic restrictions.",
  "Arrive 30-45 minutes early at the event location. Walk through the space with the camera, observing lighting conditions in different areas, identifying key spots for anticipated action, and taking a few quick test shots to confirm settings (e.g., ISO, shutter speed) are appropriate.",
  "During the event, focus on capturing key moments and interactions. Prioritize sharp focus on subjects. Shoot many photos using Program (P) mode or Shutter Priority (Tv/S) for action, constantly reviewing the last few shots for focus and exposure, adjusting only if absolutely necessary.",
  "Immediately after the event, transfer all photos from the memory card(s) to at least two separate storage locations (e.g., computer hard drive and an external drive or cloud service) and verify successful transfer before reformatting any cards."
