[
  "Install Node.js, npm, and the TypeScript compiler globally (`npm install -g typescript`), then initialize a new TypeScript project directory with `tsc --init` to set up the basic development environment.",
  "Complete an interactive tutorial covering fundamental TypeScript types (e.g., `string`, `number`, `boolean`, `any`, `unknown`, `void`, `null`, `undefined`) and practice annotating variables, constants, and function parameters/return values in small code snippets.",
  "Learn to declare and manipulate typed arrays and fixed-length tuples, and define/use enums for a set of named constants in practical coding exercises.",
  "Define object structures using TypeScript interfaces and type aliases, applying them to functions and variables to ensure type-safe data shapes.",
  "Experiment with union and intersection types to combine existing types, and apply type narrowing techniques (e.g., `typeof`, `instanceof`, `in`, equality checks) to handle varying data types safely.",
  "Implement classes with properties, methods, constructors, inheritance, and access modifiers (public, private, protected) to build type-safe object-oriented structures.",
  "Learn and apply generics to create flexible and reusable functions, interfaces, and classes that work with different data types while preserving type safety.",
  "Configure `tsconfig.json` to control the TypeScript compiler's behavior, including target ES version, module system, strictness flags, and output settings, building a small project with different configurations.",
  "Integrate a popular JavaScript library (e.g., Express, Lodash, Axios) into a TypeScript project, installing its corresponding `@types/` package to leverage type declarations and ensure type safety.",
  "Develop a small, self-contained TypeScript application (e.g., a command-line utility, a simple data processing script) that incorporates most of the learned concepts, including types, interfaces, classes, and generics.",
  "Study and experiment with advanced type manipulation, including utility types (`Partial`, `Readonly`, `Pick`, `Omit`), conditional types, and mapped types, applying them to complex typing scenarios.",
  "Set up a new project or convert an existing small project within a popular framework (e.g., React, Angular, Vue, Node.js with Express/NestJS) to use TypeScript, focusing on component/route typing and data flow."
