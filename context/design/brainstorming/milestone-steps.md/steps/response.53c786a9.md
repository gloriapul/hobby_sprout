  "Master JavaScript ES6+ Fundamentals: Complete a dedicated course or tutorial focusing on modern JavaScript features including `let`/`const`, arrow functions, template literals, destructuring, spread/rest operators, modules, asynchronous JavaScript (Promises, async/await), and array methods (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`), and successfully solve 50+ intermediate JavaScript coding challenges.",
  "Set Up React Development Environment: Successfully install Node.js and npm/yarn, then initialize a new React project using `create-react-app` or Vite, and run it locally in the browser to display a 'Hello World' message.",
  "Understand JSX and React Components: Learn the syntax of JSX, how it translates to plain JavaScript, and create your first functional React components, demonstrating a parent component rendering two distinct child components.",
  "Master Props for Data Flow: Learn to pass data from parent components to child components using props, and build a `UserCard` component that successfully receives and displays `name` and `email` props.",
  "Manage Component State with `useState` Hook: Understand component-specific data and implement the `useState` hook to create a functional counter component with 'Increment' and 'Decrement' buttons that accurately update a displayed number.",
  "Handle Side Effects with `useEffect` Hook: Learn to perform side effects using the `useEffect` hook, building a component that fetches and displays data from a public API (e.g., `JSONPlaceholder`) upon its initial render.",
  "Implement Conditional and List Rendering: Learn techniques to conditionally render components or elements based on state or props, and efficiently render lists of data using `map()` with unique `key` props, creating a component that displays a list of 5 items and a 'No items found' message if the list is empty.",
  "Handle User Events and Forms: Understand how to capture and respond to user interactions (e.g., `onClick`, `onChange`) and implement controlled components for handling form input, building a simple login form with controlled fields that alert the submitted values.",
  "Implement Client-Side Routing with React Router: Set up and use `React Router DOM` to create a basic navigation bar and two distinct pages (e.g., Home, About) that are accessible via different URLs without full page reloads.",
  "Manage Global State with React Context API: Learn how to use React's built-in Context API to share state across components, creating a theme toggle (light/dark mode) that successfully changes the theme across multiple, deeply nested components.",
  "Build a Medium-Complexity Project: Apply all learned concepts by developing a complete, interactive React application, such as a task manager (with CRUD operations), a recipe finder using an external API, or a simple e-commerce product catalog, and successfully deploy it to a platform like Netlify or Vercel.",
  "Explore Advanced Concepts and Ecosystem: Research and understand the core principles of server-side rendering (SSR) frameworks (e.g., Next.js), external state management libraries (e.g., Redux Toolkit, Zustand), and testing utilities (e.g., React Testing Library) by reviewing their introductory documentation."
